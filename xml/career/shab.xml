    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>The SOGC is the only official publication of the Swiss Confederation, which is published five
      times a week and contains the most recent official information and legally prescribed
      announcements. SOGC provides economic subjects – primarily companies in the segments of
      services, commerce, trade and industry – with relevant information on their business
      environment. The information provided is thus frequently of an operational character. 1200 –
      1500 individual publications are published daily, of which the majority are legally binding.
      Today's SOGC is well positioned in the market due to the official information and, with a
      daily circulation of 60000 users, has excellent media values.</p>
    <p>Most of the published SHAB notices (e.g. companies’ register, bankruptcies, calls for debts,
      procurement) are suitable for a structured data collection by means of forms and for an
      automated typesetting.</p>
