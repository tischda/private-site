    <p>I was employed by infeurope for 10 years. During my time in Luxembourg, I performed the
      analysis and development of web based Enterprise Application Integration (EAI) and
      e-procurement solutions, such as the:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Payment system at the Office for Harmonization in the Internal Market in Alicante</li>
      <li>Publication system for the Swiss Official Gazette of Commerce (SOGC) in Bern</li>
      <li>Système d'Information pour les Marchés Publics (SIMAP) in Luxembourg</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these long term contracts, I have been involved in many other smaller projects
      which have all worked towards improving my project management skills. You can get a general
      overview of these skills in the break down in the following pages.</p>
