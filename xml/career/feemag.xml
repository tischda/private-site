    <h2>Position</h2>
    <p>Project Manager and Business Analyst - Quality Management Department (QMD) &amp; Finance
      Department.</p>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Business analysis to improve the fee management processes across 3 organisational units and
      integration into other projects. This includes organisational and technical measures to
      automate manual tasks and make the fee management processes more efficient.</p>
    <p>I organised and moderated meetings with key users, gathered new requirements and came up with
      sensible and innovative recommendations. I applied my experience in architectural design to
      avoid data duplication and harmonise interfaces with other application modules, considering
      also quality aspects in the business (response time and data integrity for payments). As a
      confirmed expert with online web applications, I advocate a customer-oriented approach,
      simplicity and flexibility.</p>
    <p>Leveraging my UML knowledge and experience of IT organisations, I also standardized the QMD
      process mapping language and instigated the adoption of global change management at the
      OHIM.</p>
