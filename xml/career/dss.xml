      Responsible for their application in new projects, I set up a management tool (Mediawiki) and
      Continuous Integration framework (Maven, Jenkins and Sonar). This not only simplifies the
      software delivery process, but also provides real-time software quality reports.</p>
    <p>Writing of Technical Orientation and Architecture Documents (TOAD) and validation of Software
      Architecture Documents (SAD) and Integration Contracts (IC). According to the TOGAF 9
      standard, I enforced the Integration Contracts organisation in a service based (SOA) manner to
      create the service catalogue and application dependency graphs.</p>
